# Contribution Guide

## Setting Up

This project is built on VueJS v2 and uses vue-test-utils for unit testing

Everything should be installed via 
```bash
npm install
```

## Contributing

This project has been created with a TDD approach (though not strictly) to make sure it is as robust as possible. 

When adding a new feature / fixing a bug, please make sure there is a supporting test (where relevant)

Tests have been written with the following ideology:
- How components are rendered:
  >  _Given a component with state X, Y should be displayed_

- How components react to user input:
  > _Given a user clicks X, Y should happen_

To run the current app:
```bash
npm run serve
```

This can simultaneously run while developing and executing tests
```bash
npm run test:unit
```

Finally, the codebase must be linted by ESLint at all times
```bash
npm run lint
```
